# debugging
This is a repository that show 6 different programs that I corrected/debugged
You will want to debugg and figure out the problems in the code.
I already completed all of the debugging and made sure it all runs correctly

Tips: 
First scan the code to see some of the obvious mistakes
Keep running the program and read the error code
Fix the error and keep running 
You will ten get to the end of the debugging and your code should run
