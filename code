#Problem 1
# A time traveler has suddenly appeared in your classroom!
# Create a variable representing the traveler's
# year of origin (e.g., year = 2000)
# and greet our strange visitor with a different message
# if he is from the distant past (before 1900),
# the present era (1900-2020) or from the far future (beyond 2020).

elif year > 1900 & year <= 2020:
    print ("That's totally the present!")
else:
    print ("Far out, that's the future!!")



#Problem 2
# Calculating Grades (ok, let me think about this one)

# Write a program that will average 3 numeric exam grades, return an average test score, a corresponding letter grade, and a message stating whether the student is passing.

# Average	Grade
# 90+	A
# 80-89	B
# 70-79	C
# 60-69	D
# 0-59	F

# Exams: 89, 90, 90
# Average: 90
# Grade: A
# Student is passing.

# Exams: 50, 51, 0
# Average: 33
# Grade: F
# Student is failing.

exam_one = int(input("Input exam grade one: "))

exam_two = input("Input exam grade two: ")

exam_three = str(input("Input exam grade three: "))

#Problem 3

# Create a collection of these authors and
# the year they kicked the bucket;
# print the collection in the following format:
# Charles Dickens died in 1870.
# Charles Dickens, 1870
# William Thackeray, 1863
# Anthony Trollope, 1882
# Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1889

#Problem 4

# Create a print statment that prints if the answer is ARRR
otherwise print a greeting for the pirates
greeting = input("Hello, possible pirate! What's the password?")
if greeting in ["Arrr!"]:
	print("Go away, pirate.")
else:

#Problem 5 

#Create a program that askes the user for their current time and their desired wait time.
then print the final time

#Problem 6
# Create a program that askes for the user for their current time and the they want to wait. 
Then give the time in which the alarm will go off
